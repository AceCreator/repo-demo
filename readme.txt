# Demo file
glad you enjoyin that read

# Note 1
turn this into a git repository using: git init

# Note 2
git push origin master

# Note 3
before pushing what you create locally you must clone to github
--> create new repository on github
--> git remote add origin (pasteLinkFromGithub)
to check: git remote -v
now we can git push origin master

#Note 4
for future push, do an initial push: git push -u origin master
all other future pushs do not need origin master
